# Trello
Overall, Trello is very helpful during the planning and early part of the project. You can review our notes on inceptions, icebox, backlogs, userstories, and tasks completed in this link: [Trello](https://trello.com/b/keYaT8A1/team-project-3)

# API Used
We used IBM/Watson's Personality Insights API and Twitter's API. First we fetch data from the tweets and concatenated the text into one file file. Then feed the data from the tweets to Watson's Personality Insights checker, and get back the output into our app.
